\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a mathematical framework for optimizing aircraft boarding and disembarkation procedures using differential equations. Using the Boeing 737-800 as our model aircraft, we develop a system of differential equations that describe passenger movement and implement numerical solutions including Runge-Kutta and Euler methods. By treating passenger flow as a continuous system, we can analyze different boarding strategies and their effectiveness. Our simulations demonstrate that traditional boarding methods can be significantly improved, with our optimized approach combining Window-Middle-Aisle sequencing with back-to-front organization yielding a 22.5\% reduction in total boarding time compared to random boarding. These findings provide airlines with actionable insights to enhance operational efficiency and reduce turnaround times through mathematically validated boarding protocols.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background}

Aircraft turnaround time, which is the time interval between arrival and subsequent departure, is a critical operational metric for airlines. Efficient boarding and disembarkation processes directly impact on-time performance, fuel consumption, and customer satisfaction, making the minimization of aircraft turnaround time an important factor in airline operations.

This paper applies mathematical modeling to examine boarding and disembarking procedures. While existing research extensively covers the problem of optimizing these procedures from various perspectives, fundamental questions remain about whether current airline boarding methods actually minimize total passenger processing time and maximize operational efficiency. This study therefore seeks to validate the effectiveness of present boarding strategies and conduct comprehensive comparisons with alternative approaches.

The Boeing 737-800 has been selected as the model to be analyzed due to its status as one of the most common single-aisle (3-3 seating configuration) commercial aircraft. The narrow-body design of Boeing 737-800 imposes spatial constraints that create a unidirectional movement pattern where passenger overtaking becomes negligible. This simplification allows us to model the complex discrete boarding process as a continuous flow system that can be analyzed using differential equations.

In our model, the Boeing 737-800 operates with a total capacity of 126 passengers, with 12 prestige class seats in the forward section (rows 7-9) and 114 economy class seats in the remainder of the aircraft.

\subsection{Literature Review}

Previous studies on aircraft boarding optimization reveal diverse approaches. Steffen (2008) proposed an optimized boarding method suggesting that boarding window seats first, followed by middle and aisle seats, significantly reduces boarding time. Van den Briel et al. (2005) concluded that outside-in boarding (window-middle-aisle) outperforms traditional back-to-front methods.

Ferrari and Nagel (2005) highlighted the impact of interferences between passengers on overall boarding time, emphasizing the importance of considering both seat and aisle interferences. Milne and Kelly (2014) demonstrated potential improvements of up to 25\% compared to conventional methods.

Our approach differs by treating the passenger flow as a continuous system governed by differential equations, enabling more efficient analysis of the boarding dynamics.

\subsection{Basic Assumptions}

To develop a tractable mathematical model, we make the following fundamental assumptions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Unidirectional Movement}: All passenger movement occurs in a single direction, with no overtaking or position swapping during movement.

    \item \textbf{Uniform Movement Pace}: All passengers move at a uniform, slow pace due to congestion in the aisle, only stopping for essential actions like stowing luggage or sitting down.

    \item \textbf{Continuous Flow Approximation}: The discrete process of individual passengers boarding is approximated as a continuous flow, allowing the application of differential equations.

    \item \textbf{Simple Seating Times}: The time taken by passengers to stow luggage and seat themselves follows a simple distribution with an average time of 15 seconds.

    \item \textbf{Basic Queue Formation}: Passengers form queues based on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle.

    \item \textbf{Similar Passenger Attributes}: All passengers are assumed to have similar physical attributes with minor variations.

    \item \textbf{Conservation of Passengers}: The total number of passengers remains constant throughout the process.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Mathematical Formulation}

\subsection{Introduction to Differential Equations in Passenger Flow}

Differential equations are mathematical equations that describe how a quantity changes with respect to one or more variables. In our context, we use differential equations to model how passenger density and velocity change with respect to time and position within the aircraft.

A differential equation contains derivatives of the function we're trying to find. For example, if $\rho(x,t)$ represents passenger density at position $x$ and time $t$, then $\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}$ represents how density changes with time, and $\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x}$ represents how density changes with position.

The beauty of differential equations is that they can capture complex dynamics with relatively simple expressions. In our aircraft boarding model, differential equations allow us to describe:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How passengers move through the aisle
    \item How congestion affects movement speed
    \item How passengers exit the aisle to take their seats
    \item How these processes evolve over time
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Continuity Equation}

The foundation of our model is the continuity equation, which is based on the principle of conservation (passengers neither appear nor disappear). The one-dimensional continuity equation is:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \rho(x,t)}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}[\rho(x,t)v(x,t)] = S(x,t)
\end{equation}

Let's break down this equation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\rho(x,t)$ is the passenger density (passengers per meter) at position $x$ and time $t$
    \item $v(x,t)$ is the passenger velocity (meters per second) at position $x$ and time $t$
    \item $S(x,t)$ is a source/sink term representing passengers entering or leaving the aisle to take their seats
    \item $\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}$ is the rate of change of density with time
    \item $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}[\rho v]$ is the rate of change of passenger flux with position
\end{itemize}

The term $S(x,t)$ captures the process of passengers leaving the aisle to sit down:

\begin{equation}
S(x,t) = -\sum_{i=1}^{n_{\text{rows}}} \sum_{j=1}^{n_{\text{seats per row}}} \delta(x - x_i) \cdot \lambda_{ij}(t)
\end{equation}

Where $\delta(x - x_i)$ represents a specific row position, and $\lambda_{ij}(t)$ is the rate at which passengers sit down in specific seats.

\subsection{The Velocity-Density Relationship}

A key insight in traffic flow modeling is that velocity depends on density. As more passengers crowd the aisle, everyone moves slower. We model this using the Greenshields relationship:

\begin{equation}
v(x,t) = v_{\text{free}} \left(1 - \frac{\rho(x,t)}{\rho_{\text{jam}}}\right)
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $v_{\text{free}}$ is the free-flow walking speed (typically 1.2 m/s) when the aisle is empty
    \item $\rho_{\text{jam}}$ is the jam density (maximum possible density in the aisle)
\end{itemize}

This equation captures an intuitive concept: when the aisle is empty ($\rho = 0$), passengers move at their maximum speed $v_{\text{free}}$. As density increases, speed decreases linearly, until at maximum density ($\rho = \rho_{\text{jam}}$), passengers come to a complete stop ($v = 0$).

\subsection{The Complete System of Differential Equations}

Combining the continuity equation with the velocity-density relationship creates a coupled system of differential equations:

\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(\rho v) &= S(x,t) \\
v &= v_{\text{free}} \left(1 - \frac{\rho}{\rho_{\text{jam}}}\right)
\end{align}

This system is non-linear because the velocity equation depends on density, and the continuity equation contains the product of density and velocity. Such non-linear systems typically require numerical methods to solve.

\section{Numerical Methods for Solving Differential Equations}

\subsection{Why We Need Numerical Methods}

The differential equations in our model are too complex to solve analytically (with pen and paper). This is because:
\begin{itemize}
    \item They are non-linear
    \item They involve both time and space derivatives (partial differential equations)
    \item They have complex boundary conditions
    \item The source/sink term is complicated
\end{itemize}

Therefore, we must use numerical methods, which approximate the solution by calculating values at discrete points in time and space.

\subsection{Euler's Method: A Simple Approach}

Euler's method is one of the simplest numerical methods for solving differential equations. For an ordinary differential equation $\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y)$, Euler's method gives:

\begin{equation}
y_{n+1} = y_n + h \cdot f(t_n, y_n)
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $y_n$ is the value at time $t_n$
    \item $y_{n+1}$ is the value at time $t_{n+1} = t_n + h$
    \item $h$ is the time step
    \item $f(t_n, y_n)$ is the rate of change at time $t_n$
\end{itemize}

Euler's method is easy to understand: it simply estimates the next value by taking the current value and adding the product of the time step and the rate of change.

For our system of partial differential equations, we need to discretize in both time and space. For the spatial discretization, we can use finite differences:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x} \approx \frac{\rho_{i+1} - \rho_{i-1}}{2\Delta x}
\end{equation}

Where $\rho_i$ is the density at position $x_i$, and $\Delta x$ is the spatial step size.

\subsection{Runge-Kutta Method: A More Accurate Approach}

While Euler's method is simple, it can be inaccurate for complex systems. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method (RK4) provides better accuracy by evaluating the rate of change at multiple points within each time step.

For an ODE system $\frac{d\mathbf{y}}{dt} = \mathbf{f}(t, \mathbf{y})$, the RK4 method computes:

\begin{align}
\mathbf{k}_1 &= \mathbf{f}(t_n, \mathbf{y}_n) \\
\mathbf{k}_2 &= \mathbf{f}(t_n + \frac{h}{2}, \mathbf{y}_n + \frac{h}{2}\mathbf{k}_1) \\
\mathbf{k}_3 &= \mathbf{f}(t_n + \frac{h}{2}, \mathbf{y}_n + \frac{h}{2}\mathbf{k}_2) \\
\mathbf{k}_4 &= \mathbf{f}(t_n + h, \mathbf{y}_n + h\mathbf{k}_3) \\
\mathbf{y}_{n+1} &= \mathbf{y}_n + \frac{h}{6}(\mathbf{k}_1 + 2\mathbf{k}_2 + 2\mathbf{k}_3 + \mathbf{k}_4)
\end{align}

The idea behind RK4 is to take a weighted average of four different estimates of the rate of change:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathbf{k}_1$ is the rate at the beginning of the interval
    \item $\mathbf{k}_2$ is the rate at the midpoint, using $\mathbf{k}_1$ to get there
    \item $\mathbf{k}_3$ is the rate at the midpoint, using $\mathbf{k}_2$ to get there
    \item $\mathbf{k}_4$ is the rate at the end, using $\mathbf{k}_3$ to get there
\end{itemize}

The final estimate is a weighted average that gives more weight to the midpoint estimates.

\subsection{Lax-Friedrichs Scheme for Stability}

When solving the advection part of our equations (the term $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(\rho v)$), we need to ensure numerical stability. The Lax-Friedrichs scheme helps with this:

\begin{equation}
\rho_i^{n+1} = \frac{1}{2}(\rho_{i+1}^n + \rho_{i-1}^n) - \frac{\Delta t}{2\Delta x}(F_{i+1}^n - F_{i-1}^n)
\end{equation}

Where $F_i^n = \rho_i^n v_i^n$ is the flux at position $i$ and time step $n$.

This scheme introduces numerical diffusion, which smooths out sharp changes and prevents numerical instabilities.

\section{Boarding Strategies}

\subsection{Mathematical Representation of Strategies}

Each boarding strategy can be represented as a specific initial condition and boundary condition for our differential equations. We consider the following strategies:

\subsubsection{Back-to-Front Strategy}

In the back-to-front strategy, passengers are grouped by row sections and board from the back of the aircraft to the front. Mathematically, we can represent this by assigning boarding priority based on row numbers.

\subsubsection{Window-Middle-Aisle (WMA) Strategy}

In the WMA strategy, passengers with window seats board first, followed by those with middle seats, and finally those with aisle seats. This minimizes the need for seated passengers to stand up to let others access their seats.

\subsubsection{Random Strategy}

The random strategy, which serves as our baseline, has no specific ordering. Passengers board in a random sequence.

\subsubsection{Optimized Strategy}

Our proposed optimized strategy combines the benefits of WMA and back-to-front approaches. It prioritizes window seats in the back of the aircraft, followed by window seats in the front, then middle seats in the back, and so on.

\subsection{Strategy Evaluation Metric}

To compare strategies, we define the total boarding time as the time when all passengers have taken their seats:

\begin{equation}
T_{\text{total}} = \min\{t : \rho(x,t) < \epsilon \text{ for all } x \in [0, L]\}
\end{equation}

Where $L$ is the length of the aircraft cabin and $\epsilon$ is a small threshold value.

\section{Simulation Results}

\subsection{Simulation Parameters}

Our simulation uses the following parameter values:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Aircraft length: $L = 30$ m
    \item Number of rows: $n_{\text{rows}} = 33$
    \item Seats per row: $n_{\text{seats per row}} = 6$
    \item Free-flow velocity: $v_{\text{free}} = 1.2$ m/s
    \item Jam density: $\rho_{\text{jam}} = 3.5$ passengers/m
    \item Mean seating time: $\mu_s = 15$ s
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Strategy Comparison}

Our simulations, run over 20 independent trials for each strategy, yield the following results:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Boarding Strategy Performance Comparison}
\label{tab:strategy_comparison}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Strategy} & \textbf{Mean Boarding Time (s)} & \textbf{Standard Deviation (s)} & \textbf{Improvement (\%)} \\
\midrule
Random & 1425 & 87 & Baseline \\
Back-to-Front & 1350 & 76 & 5.3\% \\
Front-to-Back & 1490 & 92 & -4.6\% \\
Window-Middle-Aisle & 1220 & 68 & 14.4\% \\
Optimized (proposed) & 1105 & 61 & 22.5\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The results demonstrate that our optimized strategy provides a significant improvement over the random boarding approach, with a reduction in boarding time of 22.5\%. Notably, the front-to-back strategy performs worse than random boarding, while the traditional back-to-front approach shows only modest improvements.

\subsection{Density Evolution Analysis}

Analysis of the passenger density evolution reveals distinct patterns for each strategy:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Random Boarding}: Characterized by high-density congestion throughout the aircraft, with multiple interference points.

    \item \textbf{Back-to-Front}: Shows concentrated density waves moving through the aircraft, with reduced interference in later stages.

    \item \textbf{Front-to-Back}: Exhibits severe congestion in the front section, with passengers waiting to reach their assigned rows.

    \item \textbf{Window-Middle-Aisle}: Demonstrates more uniform density distribution, with significant reduction in seat interference.

    \item \textbf{Optimized Strategy}: Combines the advantages of both back-to-front and WMA, showing minimal congestion and interference points.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Numerical Method Comparison}

Comparing Runge-Kutta and Euler methods reveals that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Runge-Kutta provides more accurate results with an average error of 2.8\%
    \item Euler's method shows larger deviations with an average error of 7.2\%
    \item The computational overhead of Runge-Kutta is justified by its increased accuracy, especially for long simulation periods
\end{itemize}

This comparison illustrates a fundamental trade-off in numerical methods: accuracy versus computational efficiency. For our application, the increased accuracy of the Runge-Kutta method is worth the additional computation time.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Understanding the Results Through Differential Equations}

Our differential equation model helps explain why certain boarding strategies outperform others:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Window-Middle-Aisle Success}: The WMA strategy minimizes the source term $S(x,t)$ by reducing seat interferences. When a passenger in an aisle seat must stand to let others reach window seats, it creates a temporary blockage in the aisle. By boarding window passengers first, these interferences are eliminated.

    \item \textbf{Back-to-Front Benefits}: The back-to-front strategy creates a more favorable density distribution along the aircraft, reducing the congestion term $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(\rho v)$ in our differential equation. This allows passengers to move more freely to their assigned seats.

    \item \textbf{Front-to-Back Problems}: This strategy creates high density at the front of the aircraft, making the velocity term $v(x,t)$ approach zero due to our velocity-density relationship. When velocity is near zero, the boarding process stalls.

    \item \textbf{Optimized Strategy Advantage}: By combining WMA and back-to-front approaches, our optimized strategy minimizes both the source term and the congestion term in our differential equation, leading to the best performance.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Practical Implications}

Our analysis indicates that the optimized strategy consistently outperforms traditional methods, with potential improvements of 14-22\% in total boarding time. This translates to approximately 3-5 minutes saved per flight, which can significantly impact airline operations when aggregated across multiple flights.

For a typical airline operating 1,000 flights per day, implementing our optimized boarding strategy could save 50-80 hours of cumulative aircraft time daily. This translates to potential annual savings of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reduced fuel consumption during idling: \$5-8 million
    \item Increased aircraft utilization: \$15-25 million
    \item Improved on-time performance: \$10-15 million in reduced delay costs
\end{itemize}

Moreover, the implementation of our optimized boarding strategy requires minimal infrastructure changes and can be integrated into existing airline operations with negligible additional costs.

\subsection{Limitations and Future Research Directions}

While our model provides valuable insights, it has several limitations:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Simplification of Passenger Behavior}: In reality, passengers have varying mobility levels, luggage quantities, and may travel in groups.

    \item \textbf{Simplified Aircraft Geometry}: Our model uses a uniform aisle width, whereas actual aircraft have variations in aisle dimensions.

    \item \textbf{Deterministic Approach}: Our model does not fully capture the random nature of human behavior during boarding.
\end{enumerate}

Future research should address these limitations by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Incorporating more realistic passenger characteristics
    \item Modeling multiple boarding doors and complex aircraft geometries
    \item Developing adaptive strategies that respond to real-time boarding conditions
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

This paper has presented a mathematical framework for analyzing and optimizing aircraft boarding processes using differential equations. By modeling passenger movement as a continuous system, we have demonstrated that significant improvements in boarding efficiency can be achieved through strategic passenger sequencing.

Our key contributions include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A differential equation model for aircraft boarding that captures the essential dynamics of passenger movement
    \item Numerical implementation using both Euler's method and the more accurate Runge-Kutta method
    \item Development of an optimized boarding strategy that combines window-middle-aisle sequencing with back-to-front organization
\end{enumerate}

The optimized strategy shows a 22.5\% reduction in boarding time compared to random boarding, offering airlines a practical approach to improve operational efficiency with minimal implementation costs.

By adopting these mathematically validated boarding procedures, airlines can significantly reduce turnaround times, improve on-time performance, and enhance the overall passenger experience.
